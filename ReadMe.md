# OmniFocus Templates Using Calendar Alerts and AppleScript

## Update ##

As of 2013-06-07, the AppleScripts have been removed from this repo. I am no longer a OmniFocus user. It would be irresponsible and careless of me to provide scripts that I have no intention to support

If you are interested in maintaining the AppleScripts for future use, feel free to contact me.

The three Scripts in this repo show examples of how to have Calendar alerts create OmniFocus projects.

- base_example is a template that will work with AppleScript Editor
- action_group_example is a template that will work with AppleScript Editor
- automator_script_example is a template that will work with Automator.

Nota Bene: Do not run either base_example or action_group_example in Automator. There is a bit of editing needed to make them work with Automator. The lines which are different are clearly marked in automator_script_example.
