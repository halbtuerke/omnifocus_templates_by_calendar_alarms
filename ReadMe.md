# OmniFocus Templates Using Calendar Alerts and AppleScript

The three Scripts in this repo show examples of how to have Calendar alerts create OmniFocus projects.

- base_example is a template that will work with AppleScript Editor
- action_group_example is a template that will work with AppleScript Editor
- automator_script_example is a template that will work with Automator.

Nota Bene: Do not run either base_example or action_group_example in Automator. There is a bit of editing needed to make them work with Automator. The lines which are different are clearly marked in automator_script_example.
